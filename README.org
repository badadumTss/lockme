#+TITLE: LockMe
#+AUTHOR: Luca Zaninotto - badadumTss
* WIP
Software very buggy, for now can only be launched from cli and stays
there until it stops (manages to elude C-c, but not other types of
signals).
** TODO list
- Start and detach
- Better connfiguration
- Better permission managment

* How it works
Like many other programs like this overrides ~/etc/hosts~ with the
configurations generated starting from ~/etc/lockme/rules.yaml~. the
configurations are in the shape of:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  [rule_name]:
    mode: [blacklist/whitelist]   # only blacklist supported at the moment
    sites:
      - domain.com
      - domain2.com
      - ...
#+END_SRC

* How to run it
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # compile with
  cargo build
  # run with
  ./target/debug/lockme -t [TIME] -r [RULE]
#+END_SRC

* Debug/develop

** Flags
[[https://docs.rs/getopts/0.2.21/getopts/][getopts]] library, also generates the help page

** Yaml
[[https://docs.rs/yaml-rust/0.4.5/yaml_rust/][yaml-rust]], parses the configuration file in yaml_parse.rs

** Progress bar
[[https://docs.rs/indicatif/0.16.2/indicatif/][indicatif]], some customization but everything was in the first
documentation page nothing fancy

** Do not suspend
[[https://docs.rs/ctrlc/3.2.1/ctrlc/][ctrlc]] created an handle that does not terminate, once called it simply
prints /Nice try/ and returns.
